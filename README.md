## **Financial Sentiment Analytics - NLP**

This project aims to classify the sentiment of a sentence as either positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
The model was trained on a dataset containing sentences labeled with the corresponding sentiment.

## **NLP**
    - Train a classification model
    - Predict the sentiment of unseen input sentences
    - Evaluation Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
    - Prediction
      - User provides a new sentence
      - The model returns the predicted sentiment

## **Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA)**
    - Text Length Analysis
        - Compared average number of words per sentence by sentiment class
        - Positive sentences were slightly longer on average
    - Frequent Words per Sentiment
        - Most common words in each class identified
        - Removed stopwords to focus on meaningful tokens

## **Technologies Used**
    - **Python**, **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Scikit-learn**, **Nltk**
